npm init vite@latest jscourse-tmp  # This will initialize a folder named as jscourse-tmp


2. then go into that folder by typing the following on the terminal

cd jscourse-tmp


3. now install node package manager for node.js

5. create a ".env" file to hide the API secret key we got from OpenAI. We will add this .env file to .gitignore file to avoid publishing our secret key.

OPENAI_API_KEY = "your key here"


6. Before entering the command , make sure that you are in the jscourse-tmp file.Now we will create our server and for that we need to install some dependencies.After that create the server.js file and go there.

npm i dotenv express cors openai
